<p>I'm really missing you these days. Should I call you once, just to ask how are you doing. Perhaps you didn't knew that it was me last time (or maybe you got to know that it was me because of the link I provided there). Will you block me again? Are you gonna recognize my voice? Its been a long time sicence you've heard me, so I doubt. But what if you recognise my voice and block me again or scold me or say something unpleasent then I've to cry for a couple of week which I can't afford.
  And I also have got some iusse with phone calls. I just get nervus while talking on phone. I donno no why my heart starts to beat faster. This is very awkward for me. And most importantly, what I'm gonna tell you if you ask me why I called you after so many days. What I want from you ? I just don't wanna make a fool of myself. I'm in a great dillema what to do? Should I call you or not. You will drive me crazy one day. 
  
  <br><br> So You guys are going to Magic Paradise for picnic. That's  a croweded place I guess. I'm a peace loaving person. I just hate crowd. Where I'll prefer to go needs to be a very calm and quite place and where I can go a little bit close to nature and definitely that will be only a womens day out. No men will be allowed there. 
  <br><br>Your English is preety cool. We can have a very deep conversation in english. You have a accurate knowledge og grammar. If you are reading this you may notice there is so much grammatical errors here. But you can't beat me in talking I bet (Wohoo). If I could keep my nervousness aside, I can talk in english better then anyone else (like billingual/native). Auctually my toung is very flexible. I can utter better then anyone else wheather its English, hindi or Arabic. 

  
  <br><br>I was thinking to take leave from the BBA group. Frankly speaking, your group messages keeps bothering me. Hey, can you share your childhood photos with me. I really wanna see these. I just wonder, You're so cute at the age of 28-29, then how cute you were when you were 1-2 years old. Cute little baby boy holding a milk bottle (feeder) with his tiny finger, who doesen't have any teeth. Aww, so sweet. I imagine how you used to cry after falling down (oppsi daisy), I wonder how cute you used to look while sleeping, with a black round dot (tip) on your forehead. But I can't imagine your face cause your beard comes in. It looks horrible. My apologies, if you felt bad. I sometimes keep blabbering, I've a lack of common sense. I can't help, I enjoy to make fun of you. I like the way you talk, I like the way walk, I like athe way you look, I like the way smile, I like your glasses, I really like the way you block me (100% lying), I like everything about yoiu. 
  
  <br><br>  Sometime my mind tells me to give up on you, cause its all over now and Over for good. And if my instincts were true, then why would you block me. Something was continuously telling me that it't not over yet. There's still something to happen. It's just the begening of this story. There was so much positivity in my heart regarding you. Something was telling me that you are here. But now it feels like I'm losing my all hopes. There is no way to discover who visits your github profile, I seached it on google. 
  <br><br>Are you familliar with Muhammad Hoblos. He is my favorite Islamic Scholar. His significient lectures and straight to the point speach makes kim unique from other scholars. But at first he might sond a little bit loud to you but trust me eventually you are gonna love that guy I swear. 

<br><br>Why don't you upload new videos on your youtube channel. You know na, that I'm a huge fan of you. I'm done with watching the same video everyday. Could you please upload more videos for me. 
<br><br>When the third time I approach to you, with a (Fokira) website I had a conviction that  this time you'll talk to me, at least ask me how I learnt all of this. Although, I've no clue what happend there. You saw it or not. No matter, Its such a fun to work with API. I wasen't familier with API's before. I used to think what the hell is API. I created a video site using OMDBapi API keys, a weather app. But I'm stuck on a news website. I messed it up a little bit while writing code for it and debugging is so annoying. It seems arduous to deal with. Sometimes I feel that its easier to write the code over again instead of debugging.</p>
